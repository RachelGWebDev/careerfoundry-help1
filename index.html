          <h2>Portfolio Concept</h2>
          <p>-	I do not have experience in web development, so highlighting my knowledge right now in that field would be very small, and look bad.  I have worked in the hardware business for most of my working career, but this I believe is not eye catching for web development, so I will probably be leaving that out as well.  I have traveled to many different countries, and lived overseas for years.  This will probably be my focal point with trying to be eye catching and bring some well-rounded experience to the table.  I have worked in many different countries, I believe no matter what career you are in this is a great form of experience to have, to be able to connect with people of different backgrounds, and countries.  Since web development is performed all over the world, this could be a great to grow any busy.</p>

          <h2>Project Goals</h2>
          <p>-	I am working towards a new career, and I want to learn as much as possible while being careful with my time.  I will be setting goals of completing 3 exercises a week, while working 25-30 hours a week.  My hope is that I will have some weeks that I will be able to work more and complete more exercises, so I can make sure to complete this course before my time is up.  I may be going on vacation in September, I would love to be either close to being done by then, or at least ahead enough that when I do go one vacation, I will feel comfortable about taking some time off. </p>

          <h2>Course Goals</h2>
          <p>-	I am looking to change careers, and be able to be proud of what I do.  I would say that since I am very new to this world, I would like to be hired by a company so I can keep learning about this world of technology.  Maybe one day in the future work freelance, but I feel like I need to be more comfortable in how everything works, and learn so much more before I can step out on my own.  As I grow in my knowledge and learn how the web and computers work together, I would like to get a job working in the web development field.  Continually growing my knowledge and evolving as a web developer.  I am still feeling out if I want to work for a big company, or with a smaller start up or small town company.  Right now I am leaning towards a small company/start up.</p>
